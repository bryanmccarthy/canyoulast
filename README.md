# canyoulast

## Description
A survival wave game that progressively gets more difficult. The player starts with limited health and once it reaches 0, the game is over. After each a wave a number of chests spawn (amount depends on wave number) which contain potions that can be consumed by the player to increase their stats. The player has three stats: healing, strength, and speed; each stat is capped at 15 (real value: 8).
